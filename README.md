# I assessed mean antler and body size of mature (>= 4.5 years) male white-tailed deer at four military bases in Texas

## A. Data
* This is a patchy dataset of white-tailed deer harvest data dating back to 2008. The metric used for antler size is total mean beam length.  Dressed body mass is the metric for body size.

## B. Goal:
* Determine if antler and body size of mature males changes over time and differs among training sites.
* Determine how large the sample sizes are for each site and year.

#### Figure 1. Mean antler size with 95% confidence intervals of mature males at four military bases in Texas.

## C. Implications:
* You can see how small the sample sizes are just based on how wide the confidence intervals are for some sites and seasons.
* Bowie has the largest sample sizes and therefore highest confidence in estimates for mean antler size and body size.

### b. Body Size:
* For the 2021 season, Swift can be interpretted as having the largest body size among mature deer.  While Maxey has a similar estimate for mean body size, the confidence intervals are too wide to interpret with confidence.
* Body size of mature males appears to remain stable at Bowie.
* Based on data from 2019 and 2021, it might be that mature males at Swift are a bit larger than the other sites.

### c. Antler Size:
* Bowie appears to have slightly larger antler size of mature males compared to Maxey.  However, their confidence intervals overlap so the comparison is with low confidence.
* Overall, antler size of mature males is similar among the four sites. I would be curious to see what these trends looked like with much more data.
